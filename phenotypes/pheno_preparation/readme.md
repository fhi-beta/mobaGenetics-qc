# Phenotype preparation

This small [standalone script](utils/prepare_phenotypes.R) prepares the phenotypes for the genotypes QC pipeline. To execute the script, create and activate the environment under [env/r_pheno_preparation.yaml](env/r_pheno_preparation.yaml). It is not necessary to run it every time.
