## MoBa Genotypes QC
This reposirtory contains code and resources used for the quality control of genotyping data from the [Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)](https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/).

### Current release
The current release is available for alpha testing for expert users. We expect a new release to be publicly available for beta testing in the first semester of 2025. For more information on the release process, please contact the release coordinator [Dana Kristjansson](https://www.fhi.no/en/ab/departments-and-centres/genetics-and-bioinformatics/dana-hashim).

ðŸ‘‰ [Release notes and documentation](qc-pipeline/docs/release_notes.md): Documentation on the current and previous releases.

### General information on the genotypes

#### Batch effects
Samples in MoBa have been genoptyped in different batches on different genotyping platforms. Variants are not excluded based on batch effects, we recommend to account for batch effects in your own analyses. A table listing the batch for each sample is available with the data release. Information on batches is available at the [mobagen repository](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/mobagen/wiki/MoBaGenetics1.5).

#### Content
We conducted only minimal filtering to allow you to tailor the release to your project: the release includes genotypes with imputation quality > 0.3 and all samples including duplicates and outliers in the PCA. Accompanying tables are available with variant and sample information to help you filter the data for your specific application. Genotypes are available for autosomal and sex chromosomes, please note that variant coverage varies between batches, especially for the sex chromosomes. The genotypes are provided as phased dosages in the plink2 format, a single file containing genotypes of parents and children. For details on the format please refer to the [plink documentation](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/formats#pgen).

ðŸ‘‰ For more information on the data processing, please go to the [QC pipeline documentation](qc-pipeline/readme.md). 

#### Build and imputation
Currently genotypes are only available on build 37 imputed against the [Haplotype Reference Consortium Release 1.1](https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001002729) (11,227 samples).


### Other pipelines and releases
The current pipeline and its associated releases have been built on previous efforts:
- [MoBa PsychGen](github.com/psychgen/MoBaPsychGen-QC-pipeline): A quality-controlled set of genotypes created by the [PsychGen Centre for Genetic Epidemiology and Mental Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/me/the-psychgen-centre-for-genetic-epidemiology-and-mental-health).
- [MoBaGenetics v.1.0](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/mobagen/wiki/MoBaGenetics1.0): A quality-controlled set of genotypes obtained after a first round of genotyping created by the [Genetics and Bioinformatics department of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/om/organisasjon/genetikk-og-bioinformatikk/).

The pipeline is built on work for the [MoBaGenetics v.1.0](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/mobagen/wiki/MoBaGenetics1.0) release, led by Ã˜yvind Helgeland, Julius Juodakis, Jonas Bacelis, and Ronny Myhre.

It was extended thanks to help from the [PsychGen team](https://www.fhi.no/en/me/the-psychgen-centre-for-genetic-epidemiology-and-mental-health), especially Elizabeth Claire Corfield.

The pre-phasing and imputation modules have been built following the implementation of the [NORMENT team](https://www.med.uio.no/norment/english/) and the [PsychGen team](https://www.fhi.no/en/me/the-psychgen-centre-for-genetic-epidemiology-and-mental-health), especially Oleksandr Frei and Tahir Tekin Filiz.

We are grateful for the contribution of the community who helped, shared code, and provided support and feedback.
