# This snakefile executes the QC pipeline. The different parts of the pipeline are organized in modules represented in different snake files.
# The pipeline is expected to run in the conda environment named 'snpQc' built using `auxiliaries/environment/snpQc-env.txt`.
#
# Commands to execute from the qc-pipeline folder:
# conda activate snp_qc
# snakemake --snakefile Snakefile_debug_mod5 --cores 16 --use-conda --rerun-incomplete
