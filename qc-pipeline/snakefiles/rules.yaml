# Shows meta-info about the rules - typical documentation and what order they should show up in the documentation
# Each rule should match a corresponding snakemake rule
# These will be read into a dictionary and populated with results

# Minidocs for some of the fields (more to come laters)
#
# * Rule        : The rulename in the snakemake file.
# * Rule order  : Sort alphabetically by this to get the documentation/execution order.
#                 There is no guarantee that they rules are run in that order, but
#                 this is the normal order they should be documented in
# * Timetamp    : When the results of this rule was logged (UTC aka GMT)
# * rule type   : Either sample or marker
# * rule action : Wht the rule does to the date. Either remove or update
#
# Some items are not shown here at all, but will be inserted as results of the QC
# * in          : Number of markers/sample before rule
# * out         : Number of markers/sample after rule
# * actionTakenCount: Number of markers/samples affected by the rul
